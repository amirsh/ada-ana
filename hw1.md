`data.head()` returns a DataFrame containing the first 5 elements of the `data` DataFrame.

`data.tail(3)` returns a DataFrame containing the last 3 elements of the `data` DataFrame.

`data.shape` returns the shape of the `data` DataFrame object which is a tuple containing 
the number of rows as the first element and the number of columns as the second element. 
In this case it is `(8, 3)`.
